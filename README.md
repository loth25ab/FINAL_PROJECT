# FINAL_PROJECT - AI/ML Forex Signal Generator

This project is my final assignment for the AI & Machine Learning course.  
It uses historical EUR/USD forex data to extract trading signals and generate take profit / stop loss recommendations using machine learning.

The pipeline includes data collection, feature engineering (e.g., technical indicators), modeling, evaluation, and later: sentiment analysis.
