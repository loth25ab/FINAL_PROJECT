# S&P 500 Market Prediction Using Sentiment and Price Features

## Overview
This project explores the use of sentiment analysis from financial news headlines, combined with price-based features, to predict short-term movements in the S&P 500 index.
We leverage FinBERT to extract sentiment metrics from daily news and integrate them with engineered price indicators, training an XGBoost classifier to forecast market direction (negative, neutral, or positive movement).
